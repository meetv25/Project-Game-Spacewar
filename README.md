# SpaceWar Video Game

### Instructions for Game:

➢ You have a ‘Player’ – ‘Space Ship’ in bottom part of screen.

➢ There are some ‘Enemies’ – ‘Aliens in UFOs’ floating around.

➢ You can move your space ship left or right by pressing left and right arrow keys respectively.

➢ For increasing score, you have to fire ‘Attacks’ - ‘Fireballs’ using spacebar.

➢ When you press spacebar, a pair of fireballs gets released. If either or both fireballs hit an enemy, then the enemy is destroyed. To take place of that enemy, a new one appears at another random position, and your score increases by 1.

➢ If any enemy comes close to your ship and collides with it, then your game will be ‘Over’.
