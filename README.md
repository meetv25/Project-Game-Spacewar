# SpaceWar Video Game

### Instructions for Game:

➢ You have a ‘Player’ – ‘Space Ship’ in bottom part of screen.

➢ There are some (7) ‘Enemies’ – ‘Aliens in UFOs’ floating around.

➢ You can move your space ship left or right by pressing left and right arrow keys respectively.

➢ For increasing score, you have to fire ‘Attacks’ - ‘Fireballs’ using spacebar.

➢ When you press spacebar, a pair of fireballs gets released. If either or both fireballs hit an enemy then the enemy is teleported to other random position and our score increases by 1.

➢ If any enemy come close to our ship and collide with our ship then game gets ‘Over’.
